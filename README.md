User_Admission_form for Yoga_Classes

Overview
This project aims to build a web application for managing user data and payment processing for a yoga class enrollment system. The system allows users to enroll in classes, manage their preferences, and make monthly payments.

Technologies Used
Frontend: Angular (version 16), Bootstrap (version 5)
Backend: Java Spring Boot (4), MySQL
Payment Processing: (Mention the payment gateway or service used, e.g., Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

frontend/: Contains the Angular frontend codebase.
backend/: Contains the Java Spring Boot backend codebase.
database/: Contains database schema scripts or migrations.

Setup Instructions
Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend/ directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the development server using ng serve.

Backend Setup:
Open the backend project in your preferred Java IDE.
Configure database settings in application.properties or application.yml.
Run the Spring Boot application.

Database Setup:
Create a database and execute database schema scripts provided in database/ directory.

Approach

Frontend
Implemented the frontend using Angular, leveraging Angular Forms for user data collection and validation.
Utilized Bootstrap for responsive UI design.

Backend
Built a Java Spring Boot backend to handle RESTful API requests.
Used JPA/Hibernate for database interactions with MySQL.
Implemented User entity, UserRepository, UserService, UserController for managing user-related operations.
Integrated a mock PaymentService class to simulate payment processing.

Assumptions Made
The payment processing logic is mocked and doesn't interface with an actual payment gateway.
Database configurations are set up and accessible.
Certain assumptions might be made regarding user data structure or API endpoints based on project requirements.

Future Enhancements
Implement actual payment gateway integration for live payment processing.
Enhance user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Add more features like class scheduling, user dashboard, etc.
